# 2014 Local Business Tax (LBT) Receipts of Miami-Dade County

The following is a CSV file of the 2014 Local Business Tax (LBT) Receipts of Miami-Dade County. 

Per Michael Sarasti of Miami-Dade County: "[this file] includes all businesses that have applied for a local business tax in Miami-Dade County – Legally, this should include every business, but there will surely be people who have applied at the city who haven’t applied at the County – either because they don’t know or don’t want to pay the fee."

The 2013LBTcodes.xls and (duplicate) 2013LBTcodes.csv files serve as a dictionary for the individual code and category designators.

_Please note:_ while GitHub is capable of visualizing .csv files, the file in this repository is too large for GitHub's system. This can be viewed in a variety of other applications. 
In lieu of this, a CSV with a smaller sample size has been included in the data directory for rapid prototypes as well as to view from github.

Possibilities with this CSV include converting the data into a REST API for additional application development, or use in visualization projects.
