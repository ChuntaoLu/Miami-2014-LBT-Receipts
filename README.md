The following is a CSV file of the 2014 LBT Receipts of Miami-Dade County. Per Michael Sarasti of Miami-Dade County: "[this file] includes all businesses that have applied for a local business tax in Miami-Dade County – Legally, this should include every business, but there will surely be people who have applied at the city who haven’t applied at the County – either because they don’t know or don’t want to pay the fee."

Possibilities with this CSV include converting the data into a REST API for additional application development, or use in visualization projects.
